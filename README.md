# imCollec784
This repository contains some pieces of scripts and demos to perform some certain image processing and computer vision tasks. 
The [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) can help if you have problem with loading the Jupyter notebook on GitHub.

## Notebooks: 
  
* [**Sharp:**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/syumet/imCollec784/blob/master/sharp/blur.ipynb)
How does the sharpness measure change when different amounts of Gaussian blur are applied to images?   

* [**Leaf:**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/syumet/imCollec784/blob/master/leaf_segmentation/seg.ipynb)
How well can we seperate a green leaf from the photos using global thresholding?

* [**Features:**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/syumet/imCollec784/blob/master/features/hist_of_curvature.ipynb)
The *BEST* feature extractor and classifier... May exist in some circumstances?  

* [**Cats vs Dogs:**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/syumet/imCollec784/blob/master/cats_vs_dogs/keras.ipynb)
Keras + GTX 980 -> Train a simple Cat-Dog classifier in 45 Mins.
