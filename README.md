This repository contains some pieces of scripts and demos to perform some certain image processing and computer vision tasks. 
The [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) can help if you have problem with loading the Jupyter notebook on GitHub.

Activity list: 
  
* **Sharp:** How does the sharpness measure change when different amounts of Gaussian blur are applied to images?   

* **Leaf:** How well can we seperate a green leaf from the photos using global thresholding?

* **Features:** The *BEST* feature extractor and classifier... May exist in some circumstances?  

* **Cats vs Dogs:** Keras + GTX 980 -> Train a simple Cat-Dog classifier in 45 Mins.
